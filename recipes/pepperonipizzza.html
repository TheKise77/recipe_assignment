                <li><b>1/2</b> teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <br><br>
        <br>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans. </li>
           <br> <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside. </li>
            <br> <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms. </li>
           <br> <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.) </li>
           <br> <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.  </li>
           <br> <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni</li>
           <br> <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking. </li>
        </ol>
